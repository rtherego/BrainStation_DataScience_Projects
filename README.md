A brief description of the projects worked on during my Data Science Diploma at BrainStation.


# Bixi Project - Data Analysis in SQL and Visual Analytics in Tableau
Strategized the factors that influence the volume of usage, popular stations and overall business growth using SQL and data visualizations
using Tableau on the Bixi Bikes dataset. 
Showed an increase revenue by 30% from past year via memberships, timing of promotions and changes in price model.

# Stats and Politics – Cleaning, EDA and Data Analysis
Performed EDA and Data analysis for analyzing data from previous United States presidential elections. 
Linear model developed to predict the popular vote in the U.S. presidential elections from 2016 showed 62% accuracy.

# NLP With Hotel Review – EDA, Data Wrangling and Modelling
Performed sentiment analysis (counter vectorization) of hotel reviews to determine how to increase positive reviews
Used different model fits and performed feature engineering to determine improvement in prediction accuracy assessed using confusion 
matrix.

# Hackathon – Securing the Future of Food Delivery with Skip the Dishes
Worked with a multi-disciplinary, cross-country team making food delivery sustainability goals realistic to customers and restaurants. 
Food menu items should include a curated rating system called ‘Smart Score’ - factors influencing the rating - locally grown crops 
(total commodity supply), health/nutritional needs, distance delivered from and LCA emissions.

#Big Data Wrangling with Google Books Ngrams
Applied skills learnt in the Big Data Fundamentals unit to load, filter, and visualize a large real-world dataset in cloud-based 
distributed computing environment using Hadoop, Spark, and the S3 filesystem.
Followed a Big Data analysis workflow where we filter and reduce data down to a manageable size, and then do some analysis locally on 
our machine after extracting data from the Cloud and processing it using Big Data tools.
